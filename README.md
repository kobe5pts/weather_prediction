# Weather Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict weather conditions based on historical weather data. The dataset contains daily weather metrics such as precipitation, temperature (maximum and minimum), wind speed, and weather conditions (e.g., rain, drizzle). By analyzing this data, the project aims to forecast future weather conditions, enhancing decision-making for various applications.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:
- **date**: The date of the observation.
- **precipitation**: Amount of precipitation (mm).
- **temp_max**: Maximum temperature recorded (°C).
- **temp_min**: Minimum temperature recorded (°C).
- **wind**: Wind speed (m/s).
- **weather**: Weather condition (e.g., rain, drizzle, etc.).

### Sample Data
